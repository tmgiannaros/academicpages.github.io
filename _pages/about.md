## ABOUT ME 
I am an atmospheric modeler, 

Born in 1982 in Thessaloniki (Greece), I hold a Ph.D. in **Atmospheric Physics** from the
**Aristotle University of Thessaloniki** in Greece (2013). In 2014, I joined the **National
Observatory of Athens** (NOA) where I currently act as a post-doctoral researcher. My
research interests and expertise include **numerical modeling** focusing primarily on 
**severe weather**, **urban meteorology** and **climatology**, focusing on the study of the **urban
heat island** effect, **human biometeorology** with emphasis on the study of the **thermal 
bioclimate**, and regional climate modeling. I have published 22 papers in international
peer-review scientific journals (225 citations, h-index of 8). 

I work extensively with the **WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting)** numerical weather
prediction model, and the **RayMan** human-biometeorological model. I am experienced in 
several programming languages (**Fortran, Python, GDAL, NCO, CDO, Bash**), while I am also
proficient in using **geographic information systems** (Quantum GIS, ArcGIS). 

## Research interests
My research activity spans almost a decade, dating back in 2007 when I obtained my
M.Sc. diploma in Environmental Physics. Although my interests have shifted over the 
time, my research activity shows **considerable continuity** since my principal 
research directions remained unchanged. These are focused on **numerical modeling**
and, in particular, **numerical weather prediction** and **regional climate modeling**.
Hence, my research is in principle based on the exploitation of numerical models for
studying in detail the **atmospheric environment**. Areas of special focus include: 
1. Severe weather
2. Urban atmospheric environment (heat island effect)
3. Regional climate modeling
4. Renewable resources (wind and solar energy)
5. Human-biometeorology (thermal bioclimate)
6. Fire weather and fire-atmosphere interactions
7. Dust aerosols-meteorology interactions

Within the context of my doctoral studies (**2009-2013**), I specialized on the study
of the **urban thermal environment** using numerical modeling and analysis of 
observations. My research focused on the study of the **urban heat island** (UHI) 
effect and the development of a high-resolution operational heat island forecasting
system for European cities, employing a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction
(NWP) model and **artificial neural network** (ANN) techniques (Giannaros et al., 2013, 2014).
In addition, I used observations for characterizing the heat island effect of the 
city of Thessaloniki, Greece, and attempting to associate it to the degradation of
thermal comfort conditions (Giannaros and Melas, 2012). 

**Thermal comfort** has also been a major subject of my research. To this end, 
I focused on the offline **coupling** of a **NWP model** and a **microclimatic** one
(RayMan), in order to examine the spatiotemporal variability 
of thermal bioclimatic conditions over Greece (Giannaros et al., 2015a). Further, 
I have recently started the analysis of a high-resolution 20-year dataset of meteorological simulations focusing on the Mediterranean, with the aim to provide the long-term climatology of thermal bioclimatic conditions and quantify any potential trends due to climate change. 

As a post-doc researcher (2014-today), my work expanded to studying severe weather. In particular, a large part of my most recent research focuses on lightning activity. In this frame, I employed a NWP model for investigating its capacity in terms of providing lightning forecasts for increasing public awareness (Giannaros et al., 2015b, 2016a). Additionally, I exploited lightning observations in order to provide a data assimilation technique for NWP models that can be used for improving precipitation forecasts (Giannaros et al., 2016b). 

Last, my research also includes the employment of numerical modeling for supporting renewable resources applications. This is highlighted in my work that focuses on both solar (Zempila et al., 2016) and wind energy (Giannaros et al., accepted for publication). 

In terms of my present and future research directions, these are currently focused on studying the climatic effects of dust aerosols over the Mediterranean region. This work is carried out using a coupled meteorology-chemistry numerical model and aims at providing breakthrough insights on the impacts dust particles have on the radiation budget and cloud formation.

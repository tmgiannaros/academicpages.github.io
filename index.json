A sophisticated thermo-physiologically significant thermal index, namely the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET), was computed for assessing the thermal bioclimate of the study area and for investigating the presence of long-term trends, focusing on bioclimatic extremes. Results indicate that the Euro-Mediterranean thermal bioclimate follows a zonal pattern, upon which topography acts to delineate regional maxima and minima. The conducted time series analysis reveals statistically significant trends that are generally more pronounced for cold extremes. In particular, it is found that the number of days with cold (hot) stress has decreased (increased), with the distribution of PET exhibiting warming of both its cold and warm tail. The south–east Mediterranean and the Balkans are found to be the most responsive to bioclimatic changes, showing coherent and statistically significant warming trends. Overall, the results of this study provide a new point of view of the Euro-Mediterranean climate, which could be of usefulness in a wide range of future applications. The detailed spatio-temporal bioclimatic data could be exploited, for instance, to support applications related to tourism and recreation, highlighting regions with favourable or less favourable thermal comfort conditions. Furthermore, the trend data could be employed for quantifying the vulnerability of certain regions to cold and heat stress, in the context of public health applications.","tags":null,"title":"Climatology and trends of the Euro-Mediterranean thermal bioclimate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dafis S","Fierro A","**Giannaros TM**","Kotroni V","Lagouvardos K","Mansell E"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527379200,"objectID":"35e188f70453dc06ca4ab7e3597745bb","permalink":"https://tmgiannaros.github.io/publication/dafis_et_al-2018-journal_of_geophysical_research/","publishdate":"2018-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dafis_et_al-2018-journal_of_geophysical_research/","section":"publication","summary":"In this study, an explicit electrification and lightning parameterization scheme implemented within the Weather Research and Forecasting model (E-WRF, Fierro et al., https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-12-00278.1) is evaluated against selected lightning diagnostic schemes. Convection-permitting simulations of 10 high-impact weather case studies over Greece are compared against lightning observations from the ZEUS ground-based lightning detection network. The model's ability to accurately simulate these convective events is first evaluated through statistical scores of accumulated rainfall. The simulated flash origin density (FOD) fields are then assessed using statistical neighborhood methods. Overall, the simulated FOD fields have good agreement with the observations. Most of the lightning activity over the sea, however, is generally poorly forecasted. Lightning-producing events over the sea near Greece mainly occur during the cold season. Thus, lightning forecast with E-WRF appear to have better skill during the warm season. The simulated areal coverage of FOD using E-WRF also reduces the false alarms of lightning activity both over land and sea compared to a well-documented diagnostic lightning prediction scheme. Given its relatively low computational cost, these results support the potential use of E-WRF for real-time lightning predictions at convection-allowing scales.","tags":null,"title":"Performance Evaluation of an Explicit Lightning Forecasting System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giannaros C","Nenes A","**Giannaros TM**","Kourtidis K","Melas D"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519862400,"objectID":"2a6c22f35df1d2701015ae979557a0d9","permalink":"https://tmgiannaros.github.io/publication/giannaros_et_al-2018-atmospheric_research/","publishdate":"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/giannaros_et_al-2018-atmospheric_research/","section":"publication","summary":"This study presents a comprehensive modeling approach for simulating the spatiotemporal distribution of urban air temperatures with a modeling system that includes the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the Single-Layer Urban Canopy Model (SLUCM) with a modified treatment of the impervious surface temperature. The model was applied to simulate a 3-day summer heat wave event over the city of Athens, Greece. The simulation, using default SLUCM parameters, is capable of capturing the observed diurnal variation of urban temperatures and the Urban Heat Island (UHI) in the greater Athens Area (GAA), albeit with systematic biases that are prominent during nighttime hours. These biases are particularly evident over low-intensity residential areas, and they are associated with the surface and urban canopy properties representing the urban environment. A series of sensitivity simulations unravels the importance of the sub-grid urban fraction parameter, surface albedo, and street canyon geometry in the overall causation and development of the UHI effect. The sensitivities are then used to determine optimal values of the street canyon geometry, which reproduces the observed temperatures throughout the simulation domain. The optimal parameters, apart from considerably improving model performance (reductions in mean temperature bias from 0.30 °C to 1.58 °C), are also consistent with actual city building characteristics – which gives confidence that the model set-up is robust, and can be used to study the UHI in the GAA in the anticipated warmer conditions in the future.","tags":null,"title":"A comprehensive approach for the simulation of the Urban Heat Island effect with the WRF/SLUCM modeling system: The case of Athens (Greece)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Giannaros TM**","Kotroni V","Lagouvardos K","Dellis D","Tsanakas P","Mavrelis G","Symeonidis P","Vakkas T"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517443200,"objectID":"efc208ad0a0360d1c943d6b50ab0bf56","permalink":"https://tmgiannaros.github.io/publication/giannaros_et_al-2017-meteorological_applications/","publishdate":"2018-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/giannaros_et_al-2017-meteorological_applications/","section":"publication","summary":"The current study presents AEOLUS-RIO2016, an ultrahigh resolution wind forecasting system that was developed and implemented operationally for supporting the Hellenic Olympic Sailing Team during the sailing events at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Summer Olympic Games.

For this reason, we compare the model aerosol optical depth (AOD) outputs to observations, focusing on three key regions: North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the eastern Mediterranean. Three sets of four simulations have been performed for the 6-month period of spring and summer 2011. Each simulation set uses a different dust emission parametrisation and for each parametrisation, the dust emissions are multiplied with various coefficients in order to tune the model performance. Our assessment approach is performed across different spatial and temporal scales using AOD observations from satellites and ground-based stations, as well as from airborne measurements of aerosol extinction coefficients over the Sahara. Assessment over the entire domain and simulation period shows that the model presents temporal and spatial variability similar to observed AODs, regardless of the applied dust emission parametrisation. On the other hand, when focusing on specific regions, the model skill varies significantly. Tuning the model performance by applying a coefficient to dust emissions may reduce the model AOD bias over a region, but may increase it in other regions. In particular, the model was shown to realistically reproduce the major dust transport events over the eastern Mediterranean, but failed to capture the regional background AOD. Further comparison of the model simulations to airborne measurements of vertical profiles of extinction coefficients over North Africa suggests that the model realistically reproduces the total atmospheric column AOD. Finally, we discuss the model results in two sensitivity tests, where we included finer dust particles (less than 1 μm) and changed accordingly the dust bins' mass fraction.","tags":null,"title":"Sensitivity of the WRF-Chem (V3.6.1) model to different dust emission parametrisation: Assessment in the broader Mediterranean region","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dafis S","Lagouvardos K","Kotroni V","**Giannaros TM**","Bartzokas A"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"9c493a7daa30e4627be9bd5caba5cb8c","permalink":"https://tmgiannaros.github.io/publication/dafis_et_al-2017-atmospheric_research/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dafis_et_al-2017-atmospheric_research/","section":"publication","summary":"An intense and fast moving convective line that crossed Massif Central/Cévennes-Vivarais area (south France) during the field campaign of Hydrological Cycle in Mediterranean Experiment (HyMeX) — Special Observing Period 1 (SOP1) is examined.

Three different convective parameterization schemes were employed for parameterizing sub-grid cloud-top heights and consequently driving the lightning scheme. Triggering of the lightning scheme was controlled by means of a model-resolved microphysics-based masking filter, while the formulation for deriving lightning flash rates was also modified, assuming a single “marine” equation instead of the original equations discriminating between continental and marine lightning. Gridded lightning observations were used for evaluating model performance on a dichotomous decision basis. Analysis showed that the lightning scheme is sensitive to the parameterization of convection. In particular, the Kain–Fritsch convective scheme was found to outperform the Grell–Devenyi and Grell–Freitas schemes, showing a statistically significant better performance with respect to lightning prediction. This was most evident during the warm season, while smaller differences among the schemes were recorded during the cold season. Further, for all examined convective schemes, it was found that the application of the masking filter is desirable for improving model performance in terms of lightning forecasting.

Air quality simulations were performed for different emission scenarios in order to study the contribution of each natural emission source individually and together to air quality levels in Europe. The simulations reveal that the exclusion of windblown dust emissions decreases the mean seasonal PM10 levels by more than 3.3 μg/m3 (~20%) in the Eastern Mediterranean during winter while an impact of 3 μg/m3 was also found during summer. The results suggest that sea-salt aerosol has a significant effect on PM levels and composition. Eliminating sea-salt emissions reduces PM10 seasonal concentrations by around 10 μg/m3 in Mediterranean Sea during summer while a decrease of up to 6 μg/m3 is found in Atlantic Ocean during autumn. Sea-salt particles also interact with the anthropogenic component and therefore their absence in the atmosphere decreases significantly the nitrates in aerosols where shipping activities are present. The exclusion of biogenic emissions in the model runs leads to a significant reduction of secondary organic aerosols of more than 90% while an increase in PM2.5 levels in central Europe and Eastern Mediterranean is found due to their interaction with anthropogenic component.","tags":null,"title":"Impacts of natural emission sources on particle pollution levels in Europe","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Koletsis I","**Giannaros TM**","Lagouvardos K","Kotroni V"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1462060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462060800,"objectID":"fd4d2c1037b611b8e81327e12030d290","permalink":"https://tmgiannaros.github.io/publication/koletsis_et_al-2016-atmospheric_research/","publishdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/koletsis_et_al-2016-atmospheric_research/","section":"publication","summary":"The Axios Valley, located in central-northern Greece, is surrounded by complex topography that plays a significant role in the modification of wind flow, both in terms of speed and direction.

The Dudhia scheme performs best with mean relative difference of 2.2 ± 15% for clear-skies, while the differences for the other schemes range between 5 and 12% with similar standard deviations. For all-skies, the model-derived hourly GHI is overestimated for all schemes (~40-70%).For the daily averages, the model predictions are in better agreement with the measurements, mainly under all-sky conditions, with deviations of about half those of the hourly data and smaller standard deviations. There are strong indications that the differences of the model predictions from the measurements depend on the solar zenith angle and the amount of aerosols at each station.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation of WRF shortwave radiation parameterizations in predicting Global Horizontal Irradiance in Greece","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liora N","Markakis K","Poupkou N","**Giannaros TM**","Melas D"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1448928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1448928000,"objectID":"d8c6fca930029dadbea3d5905a81d2fe","permalink":"https://tmgiannaros.github.io/publication/liora_et_al-2015-atmospheric_environment/","publishdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liora_et_al-2015-atmospheric_environment/","section":"publication","summary":"The aim of this study is the application and evaluation of a new computer model used for the quantification of emissions coming from natural sources. The Natural Emissions Model (NEMO) is driven by the meteorological data of the mesoscale numerical Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and it estimates particulate matter (PM) emissions from windblown dust, sea salt aerosols (SSA) and primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs). It also includes emissions from Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOCs) from vegetation; however, this study focuses only on particle emissions. An application and evaluation of NEMO at European scale are presented. NEMO and the modelling system consisted of WRF model and the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions (CAMx) were applied in a 30 km European domain for the year 2009. The computed domain-wide annual PM10 emissions from windblown dust, sea salt and PBAPs were 0.57 Tg, 20 Tg and 0.12 Tg, respectively. PM2.5 represented 6% and 33% of emitted windblown dust and sea salt, respectively. Natural emissions are characterized by high geographical and seasonal variations; windblown dust emissions were the highest during summer in the southern Europe and SSA production was the highest in Atlantic Ocean during the cold season while in Mediterranean Sea the highest SSA emissions were found over the Aegean Sea during summer. Modelled concentrations were compared with surface station measurements and showed that the model captured fairly well the contribution of the natural sources to PM levels over Europe. Dust concentrations correlated better when dust transport events from Sahara desert were absent while the simulation of sea salt episodes led to an improvement of model performance during the cold season.","tags":null,"title":"The natural emissions model (NEMO): Description, application and model evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Giannaros TM**","Kotroni V","Lagouvardos K"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1427846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1427846400,"objectID":"b8a3347e31ac1e26fde7ae118fdbf224","permalink":"https://tmgiannaros.github.io/publication/giannaros_et_al-2015-atmospheric_research/","publishdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/giannaros_et_al-2015-atmospheric_research/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, significant progress has been made in the development and implementation of parameterizations for the prediction of lightning. In the present study, the commonly used Price and Rind lightning parameterization is evaluated. This parameterization has been recently introduced in the state-of-the-art Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, allowing for the online simulation of lightning activity. The evaluation of the parameterization is conducted for ten different single-day events that took place in Greece during the period of years from 2010 to 2013. Results show that the WRF model could be used for real-time lightning prediction applications, given that the lightning parameterization is properly adapted. In particular, the analysis revealed that model-resolved variables related to the microphysics and thermodynamics are necessary for controlling the parameterization of lightning, which otherwise results to significant overprediction. The total ice content, the maximum vertical velocity and the convective available potential energy were found to be the storm parameters that, when combined together, improve the ability of the model to correctly predict lightning, significantly restricting false alarms. This was further highlighted by separately examining two example case studies, for which the numerical simulations successfully reproduced the spatial and temporal characteristics of lightning activity.","tags":null,"title":"Predicting lightning activity in Greece with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karagiannidis A","Poupkou A","**Giannaros TM**","Melas D","Argiriou A"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"2e8e84b5292db317d12868429ea48f4b","permalink":"https://tmgiannaros.github.io/publication/karagiannidis_et_al-2015-water_air__soil_pollution/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/karagiannidis_et_al-2015-water_air__soil_pollution/","section":"publication","summary":"The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the most basic features of the air quality of a Mediterranean urban environment area.

The MM5-CAMx modeling system was applied in the Eastern Mediterranean in high spatial and temporal resolution for the period 23 to 31 August 2007, forced by biomass burning emission fluxes from the Global Fire Emissions Database (version 3.0), in day-to-day temporal and 0.1° spatial variability from the Global Fire Assimilation System. Enhancements of the CO and NOx concentrations over almost the entire modeling domain were estimated due to the biomass burning, which were more pronounced over the burnt areas and maximum over the Peloponnesus forest fires. The domain-wide near surface mean concentration was higher by +6% for CO and +11% for NOx because of the biomass burning. The near surface O3 values were reduced over the fire hot spots but increased over the greater part of the modeling domain. On the 26th August 2007, the maximum O3 concentrations reduction of about 12ppb (i.e. -34%) was calculated over the Peloponnesus fires while the highest O3 increase of about 27ppb (i.e. +52%) was estimated over the sea at 500km downwind the Peloponnesus large forest fires. The process analysis revealed that on that day, the inclusion of the biomass burning emissions resulted in an enhancement of the daytime gas phase O3 production in the boundary layer in the Eastern Mediterranean and during some daytime hours in a change of the chemical regime from O3 destruction to O3 production. From 6 to 16 UTC, the O3 photochemistry in the boundary layer was VOC-sensitive close to the Peloponnesus fires, gradually changing to NOx-sensitive in the downwind fire plume. In the same period, the maximum impact on the oxidizing capacity of the boundary layer was an increase by 0.25ppt for OH and a reduction by 13ppt for HO2 mean concentrations over the Peloponnesus forest fires and an increase by 12ppt for HO2 in the downwind plume.

It represents a significant urban climate problem since it occurs in the layer of the atmosphere where almost all daily human activities take place.

The modeling system is built around a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction model, properly modified to allow for the better representation of the urban climate. The model performance in terms of simulating the near-surface air temperature and thermal comfort conditions over the complex urban area of Athens, Greece, is evaluated during a 1.5-month operational implementation in the summer of 2010. Results from this case study reveal an overall satisfactory performance of the modeling system. The discussion of the results highlights the important role that, given the necessary modifications, a meteorological model can play as a supporting tool for developing successful heat island mitigation strategies.

The advantage of the numerical modeling approach lies in that it can be applied in areas where there is lack of observational data, providing a detailed insight on the prevailing thermal bioclimatic conditions. However, this approach should be exploited carefully since model simulations can be frequently biased. The aim of this paper is to examine the suitability of a mesoscale atmospheric model in terms of evaluating thermal bioclimate. For this, the numerical weather prediction Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the radiation RayMan model are employed for simulating thermal bioclimatic conditions in Greece during a 1-year time period. The physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) is selected as an index for evaluating thermal bioclimate, while synoptic weather station data are exploited for verifying model performance. The results of the present study shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of the numerical modeling approach. Overall, it is shown that model simulations can provide a useful alternative tool for studying thermal bioclimate.

The minimum and maximum intensity of the canopy-layer heat island were found to occur in early morning and during the night, respectively. The simulations, in agreement with concurrent observations, showed that the intensity of the canopy-layer heat island has a typical diurnal cycle, characterized by high nighttime values, an abrupt decrease following sunrise, and an increase following sunset. The examination of the spatial patterns of the land surface temperature revealed the existence of a surface urban heat sink during the day. In the nighttime, the city surface temperature was found to be higher than its surroundings. Finally, a simple data assimilation algorithm for satellite-retrieved land surface temperature was evaluated. The ingestion of the land surface temperature data into the model resulted to a small reduction in the temperature bias, generally less than 0.2 °C, which was only evident during the first 4-5 h following the assimilation.","tags":null,"title":"Numerical study of the urban heat island over Athens (Greece) with the WRF model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Giannaros TM**","Melas D"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1352937600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1352937600,"objectID":"39df846ce1742cb9008ab1765d356d82","permalink":"https://tmgiannaros.github.io/publication/giannaros_et_al-2012-atmospheric_research/","publishdate":"2012-11-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/giannaros_et_al-2012-atmospheric_research/","section":"publication","summary":"The urban heat island in the coastal city of Thessaloniki, Greece, is investigated using near-surface temperature data measured at 7 sites in the greater Thessaloniki area for the 1-year period from March 2008 to February 2009. The urban heat island in Thessaloniki is stronger in the nighttime than in the daytime and decreases with increasing wind speed, while there are indications that it is more pronounced during the warm half of the year. Observations of the maximum urban heat island intensity range from 2. °C to 4. °C and from 1. °C to 3. °C during the warm and the cold part of the year, respectively, showing a smaller variability during the summer moths than in the winter. Greatest values are more usually observed following sunset, whereas minimum values are detected during solar peak hours. A regression analysis is carried out to investigate the impact of moisture availability and wind speed on the development of the urban heat island in Thessaloniki. It is found that the nocturnal heat island results to increased nighttime water vapor pressure in the urban areas, whereas during the day the heat island intensity and urban/semi-rural water vapor pressure differences are found to be anti-correlated. Furthermore, the intensity of Thessaloniki's heat island appears to decrease significantly when wind speed exceeds 4. m/s. The impact of the urban heat island on human thermal comfort in Thessaloniki is also investigated, computing hourly values of the discomfort index and the approximated wet bulb globe temperature. The center of the city is found to exhibit the highest discomfort index and approximated wet bulb globe temperature values. In addition, the urban heat island is found to have a negative impact on thermal comfort on most of the observed occasions. In particular, a 1.5. °C increase in the urban heat island intensity appears to result to an average 1. °C increase in discomfort index and 1.4. °C increase in approximated wet bulb globe temperature of the urban area on about 50% and 75% of the cases, respectively.

The model allows the emissions calculation for any modeling domain covering Europe on the basis of: 1) the U.S. Geological Survey 1-km resolution land-use database, 2) a land-use specific, monthly isoprene, monoterpene and Other Volatile Organic Compound (OVOC) emission potentials and foliar biomass densities database, 3) temperature and solar radiation data provided by the mesoscale meteorological model MM5. The model was applied for Europe in 30-km spatial resolution for the year 2003. The European total emissions for 2003 consist of 33.0% isoprene, 25.5% monoterpenes and 41.5% OVOC. BEM results are compared with those from the well-documented global Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN). The BEM total emissions compare well with the MEGAN ones. In July 2003, the results of both models agree within a factor of 1.2 for total isoprene emissions and within a factor of 2 for total monoterpene emissions. The comparison of the spatial distributions of the July 2003 isoprene and monoterpene emissions calculated with BEM and MEGAN shows that, in the greater part of the study area, the differences are below the current uncertainty limit for the estimation of spatially-resolved biogenic VOC emissions in Europe being equal to about ±600 kg km-2 month-1. Differences that are above this limit are found mainly in the eastern European countries for isoprene and in the Mediterranean countries for monoterpenes.","tags":null,"title":"A model for European Biogenic Volatile Organic Compound emissions: Software development and first validation","type":"publication"}]

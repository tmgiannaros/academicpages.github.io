#### Abstract
A grid-oriented Biogenic Emission Model (BEM) has been developed to calculate 
Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compound (NMVOC) emissions from vegetation in high 
spatial and temporal resolutions. The model allows the emissions calculation for 
any modeling domain covering Europe on the basis of: 1) the U.S. Geological Survey 
1-km resolution land-use database, 2) a land-use specific, monthly isoprene, monoterpene
and Other Volatile Organic Compound (OVOC) emission potentials and foliar biomass 
densities database, 3) temperature and solar radiation data provided by the mesoscale 
meteorological model MM5. The model was applied for Europe in 30-km spatial resolution 
for the year 2003. The European total emissions for 2003 consist of 33.0% isoprene, 
25.5% monoterpenes and 41.5% OVOC. BEM results are compared with those from the 
well-documented global Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN). 
The BEM total emissions compare well with the MEGAN ones. In July 2003, the results 
of both models agree within a factor of 1.2 for total isoprene emissions and within 
a factor of 2 for total monoterpene emissions. The comparison of the spatial 
distributions of the July 2003 isoprene and monoterpene emissions calculated with 
BEM and MEGAN shows that, in the greater part of the study area, the differences
are below the current uncertainty limit for the estimation of spatially-resolved 
biogenic VOC emissions in Europe being equal to about ±600 kg km−2 month−1. 
Differences that are above this limit are found mainly in the eastern European 
countries for isoprene and in the Mediterranean countries for monoterpenes.

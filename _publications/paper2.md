### Abstract
>The urban heat island in the coastal city of Thessaloniki, Greece, is investigated 
using near-surface temperature data measured at 7 sites in the greater Thessaloniki 
area for the 1-year period from March 2008 to February 2009. The urban heat island in 
Thessaloniki is stronger in the nighttime than in the daytime and decreases with 
increasing wind speed, while there are indications that it is more pronounced during 
the warm half of the year. Observations of the maximum urban heat island intensity 
range from 2 °C to 4 °C and from 1 °C to 3 °C during the warm and the cold part of 
the year, respectively, showing a smaller variability during the summer moths than in 
the winter. Greatest values are more usually observed following sunset, whereas
minimum values are detected during solar peak hours. A regression analysis is carried 
out to investigate the impact of moisture availability and wind speed on the development
of the urban heat island in Thessaloniki. It is found that the nocturnal heat island 
results to increased nighttime water vapor pressure in the urban areas, whereas during
the day the heat island intensity and urban/semi-rural water vapor pressure differences
are found to be anti-correlated. Furthermore, the intensity of Thessaloniki's heat 
island appears to decrease significantly when wind speed exceeds 4 m/s. The impact 
of the urban heat island on human thermal comfort in Thessaloniki is also investigated,
computing hourly values of the discomfort index and the approximated wet bulb globe 
temperature. The center of the city is found to exhibit the highest discomfort index 
and approximated wet bulb globe temperature values. In addition, the urban heat 
island is found to have a negative impact on thermal comfort on most of the observed 
occasions. In particular, a 1.5 °C increase in the urban heat island intensity appears
to result to an average 1 °C increase in discomfort index and 1.4 °C increase in 
approximated wet bulb globe temperature of the urban area on about 50% and 75% of the 
cases, respectively.

excerpt: 'This paper presents the development of an operational forecasting service 
focusing on human-biometeorological conditions. The service is based on the coupling of 
numerical weather prediction models with an advanced human-biometeorological model. 
Human thermal perception and stress forecasts are issued on a daily basis for Greece, 
in both point and gridded format. A user-friendly presentation approach is adopted for 
communicating the forecasts to the public via the worldwide web. The development of the
presented service highlights the feasibility of replacing standard meteorological 
parameters and/or indices used in operational weather forecasting activities for 
assessing the thermal environment. This is of particular significance for providing 
effective, human-biometeorology-oriented, warnings for both heat waves and cold 
outbreaks.'

# About me

I am an atmospheric modeler fascinated by the powerful nature of our planet's 
atmosphere that drives the various phenomena in which I am interested. 

My research activity spans almost a decade, dating back in 2007 when I obtained my 
MSc Environmental Physics. Although my interests have shifted over the time, my 
research activity shows considerable continuity since my principal research directions
remained unchanged. These are focused on numerical modeling and, in particular, 
numerical weather prediction and regional climate modeling. Hence, my research is 
in principle based on the exploitation of numerical models for studying in detail the
atmospheric environment. Areas of special focus include severe weather, the urban 
environment (heat island effect), regional climate, renewable resources (wind and 
solar energy), human-biometeorology, and most recently fire-atmosphere interactions.
